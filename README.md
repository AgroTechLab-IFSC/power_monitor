## (1.2.0)

The Power Monitor aims to monitor the energy consumption of IoT devices.  
It provides the following information:

* Actual voltage (in V);
* Average voltage (in V);
* Minimal voltage (in V);
* Maximum voltage (in V);
* Actual current (in mA);
* Average current (in mA);
* Minimal current (in mA);
* Maximum current (in mA);


The data on user interface are updated at each 3 seconds.  
The average values are computed based on values sampled at each 50 ms.
